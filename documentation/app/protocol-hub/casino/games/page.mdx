## Behind the Scene

This streamlined process ensures that players can enjoy a hassle-free betting experience while benefiting from the transparency and security of blockchain technology.

<Steps>
### Step 1: Place Your Bet
The player places their bet by confirming the transaction. This action initiates the betting process.

### Step 2: Transaction Details
The transaction will deduct the player's bet amount along with some gas token required for the transaction and the Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) fee.

### Step 3: Bet Resolution
Once the transaction is processed, the bet is resolved automatically.

### Step 4: Payouts
If the player wins, BetSwirl's bankroll will automatically initiate the transaction to transfer the winnings directly to the player's wallet. There is no need for the player to withdraw or claim their winnings manually.
